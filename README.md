# Storage Bot

this discord bot will manage remote storage options per user through discord. And eventually be able to connect to a cloud storage system of the userâ€™s choice.

This application is still in development.

For Users:
	Invite the bot to the guild you would like to access it from. The bot will only take slash commands. 
    Main commands:
